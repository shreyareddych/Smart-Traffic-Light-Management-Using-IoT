# Smart Traffic Light Management Using IoT

This project implements a smart traffic light system using Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to simulate a real-time traffic light controller. The system detects vehicle presence in different lanes and adjusts the traffic lights accordingly.

## Features
- Detects the presence of vehicles in four lanes using input signals.
- Controls traffic lights dynamically based on vehicle presence.
- Simulates traffic management with red, yellow, and green lights for each lane.

## Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO support).
- Python 3 installed on the Raspberry Pi.
- `RPi.GPIO` library for GPIO control.
